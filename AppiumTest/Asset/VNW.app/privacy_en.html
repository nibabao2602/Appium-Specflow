                <div class="faq_answer">The VietnamWorks.com career website collects information in several ways from
                    different parts of our website.
                    <p>Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your
                        name and email address. The system may also ask for your street address, city, state/province,
                        zip/postal code, country, telephone number, billing information, and the URL of your web site,
                        although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are
                        required. VietnamWorks also collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique
                        to you such as your age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or
                        may collect a combination of the two types of information. Once you register you are no longer
                        anonymous to VietnamWorks Website - you have a username and are able to take full advantage of
                        the many offerings of the VietnamWorks Website career website.</p>

                    <p>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including
                        (but not limited to) when you place jobs or take advantage of the other features of the
                        VietnamWorks Website recruiting website. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that
                        correspondence.</p>

                    <p>Every page within the VietnamWorks Website recruiting website includes a link to this Privacy
                        Policy.</p>

                <div class="faq_answer">When you are asked for personal information on the VietnamWorks Website, you are
                    sharing that information with the VietnamWorks Website alone, unless it is specifically stated

                    being revealed to other users of the VietnamWorks Website. For example, when you enter personal
                    information on the job posting form, this information will generally be included in your job, unless
                    specifically stated otherwise.

                    and demographic information or information about your use of the VietnamWorks Website (such as the
                    areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth in the following five
                    subparagraphs.
                    <p>1. We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For
                        example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or
                        services of third parties at the time you register for a VietnamWorks Website account, we may
                        supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, candidates, job
                        seekers, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or
                        otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have about you (such as the interests and
                        preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the products or
                        services of a particular third-party.</p>

                    <p> 2. We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions
                        on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing
                        assistance, processing credit card or other types of payments, and providing customer service.
                        These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to
                        perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.</p>

                    <p> 3. We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a
                        governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform
                        to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of
                        Navigos Group, Ltd. or its partner companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security;
                        or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>

                    <p> 4. We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a
                        substantial portion of Navigos Group, Ltd.'s business, whether such acquisition is by way of
                        merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in
                        the event Navigos Group, Ltd. becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary
                        or involuntary, Navigos Group, Ltd. or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise
                        dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.</p>

                    <p> 5. We may use your name, your company's name or logo, or any other information about or from
                        your job postings or resume viewing account for any and all of Navigos Group, Ltd.'s or
                        VietnamWorks Website's marketing purposes. For example, company names or logos may be used in
                        newspaper advertising, direct mail pieces, sales kits, posters and other materials related to
                        VietnamWorks Website or other properties of Navigos Group, Ltd.</p>

                    <p> Navigos Group, Ltd. may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each of
                        its Web sites (for example, the number of visitors to VietnamWorks Website's 'Search Jobs'
                        section) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the
                        kinds of visitors to the VietnamWorks Website website and how those visitors use the site.</p>

                    <p> Navigos Group, Ltd. may supply technology, hosting and related services to other leading
                        companies to power recruitment areas on their websites (sometimes referred to as "private label
                        recruitment areas"). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in private label
                        recruitment areas becomes part of the VietnamWorks Website database, but it is not accessible by
                        anyone other than you, Navigos Group, Ltd. and the company concerned without your consent.</p>

                    <p>Information gathered on a page in a private label recruitment area, or on a co-branded page (such
                        as that of a contest co-sponsored by VietnamWorks Website and another company), may become the
                        property of the other company or of both Navigos Group, Ltd. and the other company. In that
                        instance, the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the privacy policy
                        of that company and, in any event, Navigos Group, Ltd. is not responsible for that company's use
                        of your personal or demographic information</p>

                    <p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. VietnamWorks Website will never ask

                        VietnamWorks Website recruiting website. This is to ensure that others cannot access your

                <div class="faq_answer">
                    <p>VietnamWorks Website is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for
                        permission before sending personal information to anyone online. VietnamWorks Website does not
                        share personal information about users who indicate they are under the age of 13 with third
                        parties. In addition, VietnamWorks Website will not send any direct email offers to users who
                        indicate they are under the age of 13.</p>

                        others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you
